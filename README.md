# PLP: Programming Language Project 
Course: CS330 Structure and Organization of Programming Language

PLP is a repository containing homework assignments for the class's programming language project. In the following weeks, I will explore a new language and learn about its design. This will include a study of its programming paradigms.

## Language of Choice 

**Rust**.
